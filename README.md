# Hack the Budget

## Problem Statement: 

**How might we get broad citizen input on the city budgeting process and move the City towards the model of [participatory budgeting (PB)](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/what-is-pb/)?**

For more info, check out the original [project proposal](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/70).

## What are we working on now?:

Right now, we are designing and ideating in preparation for a proof-of-concept working prototype app that will be used at the [Budget Game Night hosted by the Austin Monitor & Glasshouse Policy](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/budget-game-night-tickets-26423729085?aff=ehomecard) on **August 16th, 2016**.
