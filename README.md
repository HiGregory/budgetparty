# Budget Party 305 Edition

<img src="http://dsh.re/af3f9" width="300"/>

## Problem Statement: 

**How might we get broad citizen input on the city budgeting process and move the City towards the model of [participatory budgeting (PB)](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/what-is-pb/)?**

[Original Project Proposal](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/70)

## What are we working on now?:

We've currently forked Austin Budget Party and our mapping out a way to add City of Miami budget data to this experience.

Once we do that we will re-think each design process of the current interface to match our own idea of what this should look like.
