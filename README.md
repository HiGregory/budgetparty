# Hack the Budget

**How might we get broad citizen input on the city budgeting process and move the City towards [participatory budgeting](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/what-is-pb/)?**

## What are we working on now?

We are working with Glasshouse Policy & the Austin Monitor to get a baseline prototype working for an public event on August 16th.

Right now, we are designing and ideating.

[See design mocks and assets here.](./design)
