## Problem Statement: 

**How might we get broad citizen input on the city budgeting process and move the City towards the model of [participatory budgeting (PB)](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/what-is-pb/)?**

[Original Project Proposal](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/70)

## What are we working on now?:

We're currently working to modify and extend the orignial budget party app to develop a Digital Mock City Council experience.
