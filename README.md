## Problem Statement: 

**How might we get broad citizen input on the city budgeting process and move the City towards the model of [participatory budgeting (PB)](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/what-is-pb/)?**

[Original Project Proposal](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/70).


## What are we working on now?:

Right now, we have designed and built a proof-of-concept working prototype app that will be used at the [Budget Game Night hosted by the Austin Monitor & Glasshouse Policy](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/budget-game-night-tickets-26423729085?aff=ehomecard) on **August 16th, 2016**.

We will want to interate on our progres and include more features.
