# Hack the Budget

**How might we get broad citizen input on the city budgeting process and move the City towards [participatory budgeting](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/what-is-pb/)?**

## What are we working on now?

We are working with Glasshouse Policy & the Austin Monitor to get a baseline prototype working for an public event on August 16th.

Right now, we are designing and ideating.

[See design mocks and assets here.](./design)

## Getting started

As of now, we have two main folders:
1. ["app"](./app) is where code lives.
2. ["design"](./design) is where design assets live.

Before you do any of the steps below, you need to be inside the `app` folder.

`cd app`

### Installation

1. `npm install`

### Development

1. `npm start`
2. visit http://0.0.0.0:1111/ in your browser

### Build

1. `npm run build`
